I'm an academic librarian in preparatory service working at the [University Library](https://www.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/home_en) of the [Goethe University](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/en?locale=en) in Frankfurt.

I did my PhD at the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.ling.uni-konstanz.de/en/) of the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/). The focus of my academic research was on the semantics and pragmatics of conditionals, specialising on accounting for the felicity distribution of reverse Sobel sequences. The main goal of my research was to further the debate between the dynamic strict approach and the variably-strict approach to modelling conditionals. My thesis supervisors were [Maribel Romero](https://ling.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de/pages/home/romero/), [María Biezma](https://mariabiezma.com/), and [Regine Eckardt](https://www.ling.uni-konstanz.de/eckardt/personen/prof-dr-regine-eckardt/).
