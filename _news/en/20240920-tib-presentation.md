I was invited by [Dr. Sarah Dellmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahdellmann/) to present parts of [my master's thesis](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11506620) at the [German National Library of Science and Technology](https://www.tib.eu/en/) (abbreviated to [TIB](https://www.tib.eu/en/) in German) in Hannover via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) as part of a larger programme about research data.

The programme also included a very interesting presentation about the research project ["Forschungsdaten von Hochschulschriften publizieren" ("FoHop!")](https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-bib-info/frontdoor/index/index/year/2024/docId/19089) by Olga Engelhardt, Petra Gugat, and [Anna-Karina Renziehausen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-karina-renziehausen-28861ab9/) as well as another very fascinating presentation about automated subject indexing of research data sets by [Dr. Holger Israel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-israel-28b94b90/).

I had great fun presenting my own work – and even greater fun listening to the other presentations – and want to extend my gratitude to the organizers and participants of this programme!
