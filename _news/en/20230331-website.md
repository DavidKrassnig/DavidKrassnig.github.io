I've finally launched the new version of my website. It is now multilingual and available in English, German, and Esperanto.

---

This website is hosted by [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is based upon the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered template ["multi-language-al-folio"](https://github.com/george-gca/multi-language-al-folio) by [George C. de Ara√∫jo](https://george-gca.github.io/).
Said template is, in turn, a multilingual fork of [Maruan Al-Shedivat](https://maruan.alshedivat.com/)'s awesome website template "[al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)".

Many thanks to all contributors to either template!
